# TDI-capstone

This repo includes the code for my data incubator capstone project. The project is a algoritmic trading system that uses reinforcement learning to try and teach a neural network how to trade.

Currently the model is profitable under certian conditions. Specifically trading fees must be set to zero or else it simply loses money. That being the case I don't think the current system is deployable in a real market, but maybe with some more work it can be.
